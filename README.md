# Energy Optimizer

This Python script provides an energy distribution optimizer using linear programming. It determines the most cost-effective way to distribute energy from multiple sources to various consumers, considering supply limits, demand requirements, and transmission costs.

## Features

- Define custom energy sources and consumers
- Input supply capacities and demand needs
- Use cost matrices for source-to-consumer energy transmission
- Employ linear programming (via PuLP) to optimize total cost
- Clear tabular output of distribution and costs

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/)

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pulp

Usage

Run the script:

python energy_optimizer.py

The script will:

Print the optimized energy distribution plan

Display the total cost

Show energy sent from each source to each consumer


Example Output

Optimal Energy Distribution Plan:
From Source_A to Consumer_1: 100.0 units
From Source_B to Consumer_2: 200.0 units
...
Total Cost: 1234.56

Customization

To use your own data:

Modify the sources, consumers, supply, demand, and costs dictionaries at the top of the script.
